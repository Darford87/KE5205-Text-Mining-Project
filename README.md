Text Analytics on Construction Fatal Accidents Summary Report

Despite improvement in recent years, the construction industry remains the top contributor for workplace fatalities in Singapore. Similarly, poor construction safety performance can be observed in other countries. Construction accidents not only cause significant human suffering, they affect project progress and costs and the poor safety record damages the reputation of the industry and companies involved. 

Many have proposed the use of leading indicators such as inspection findings, audit score and safety climate surveys to help construction-related organizations, e.g. large developers and contractors, forecast safety performance and improve safety risk controls proactively. However, these leading indicators were not created using rigorous methods and were not known to be reliable.

In construction industry, after a fatal or catastrophic accident happens, an inspection is conducted in response, generating a report including a Fatality and Catastrophe Investigation Summary. The summaries provide a complete description of the incident, generally including events leading to the incident and causal factors. These summaries can be analyzed to identify occupations and workplace activities that face higher safety risks than others. 

Based on the result of analysis, construction project managers and safety professionals can then take appropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks and prevent the occurrence of similar accidents.

MsiaAccidentCases.xlsx is a small sample of accident summaries collected from Malaysia, which have been manually labelled with 9 main causes of accidents:  caught in/between objects, collapse of object, drowning, electrocution, exposure to chemical substances, exposure to extreme temperatures, falls, fires and explosions, struck by moving objects, suffocation, and others.

The other document, osha.xlsx, is much larger. Due to resource constraint, itâ€™s not labeled with the main causes.

1.	Which type of accidents (in terms of main causes) are more common in fatal or catastrophic accidents?

2.	What are the more risky occupations in such accidents?

3.	Which parts of human body are more prone to be injured in such accidents

4.	What are the common activities that the victims were engaged in prior to the accident?
